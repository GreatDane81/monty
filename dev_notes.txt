- Tried an OOP approach to building the board. Seems awkard, so I'm going to use Numpy instead, and modify the board as the game goes along.

- Will probably need some parsing on get_moves, probably to handle pawn promotion, checkmate, etc. Just play with it and figure out what needs to be done.

Training portion TODO:

- Build the Numpy representation of the board, which will be modified after every move. Each move should be fed into a constant Tensor and stored along with the actual stockfish evaluation for training examples.
	* It's not clear if I should serialize the training set, or 		  if I should elect to chose some other approach 
	  to store the Tensor.

- How do I store the model after it's been trained? I want the code to be portable without having to retrain. 

AI portion TODO:

- Figure out depth of Min/Max algorithm

- Building the decision tree will be difficult given that I want level searching to be O(n). I'm thinking of a tree where each level is a linked list, so you can keep an array of the start node for each level and find the min/max that way instead of traversing up and across a bunch of levels. Lots of room to screw that up, though.

Update on AI portion:

- Going to abondon tree idea. Slow, and uses a ton of computation that Stockfish is already doing. Will just do a straight linear regression on Stockfish evaluation. 

- Going to still rely on Stockfish for the mating nets, because it's just a pain to program them. Why do the work that's already done for me? Besides, it's not the point.
