Ok, so a lot of progress was made today.

Shifted from loss of 8k, to 104k (!!!) down to 170 ish with no training. 

Biggest shift was convolutional network instead of flattening the input: I went through the trouble of making the data relate logically in space, that must be reflected in the network. Can't just flatten and hope you're chilling. You lose the relationship
